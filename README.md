# XtractOctave

XtractOctave is a bunch of octave functions which wrap the functions found in LibXtract.

At the moment this has only been tested under Linux.
I'm fairly sure getting it all working under OSX would be pretty simple.
Windows is a completely different matter and will probably take a lot of work.

## Dependencies

You will need LibXtract, which you can find here:
https://github.com/jamiebullock/LibXtract/

For the moment the 'harmonic product spectrum' and 'irregularity' functions don't work properly with that version of LibXtract. 

I have a fork of LibXtract which they work with however.

You will also need the Octave package developer libraries. These are available in the octave-pkg-dev package in ubuntu. 

## Installation

Install the above dependencies first, then (all being well) running make in the XtractOctave directory should build everything for you.

If that worked there should now be a load of .oct file in the directory. If these files are in Octave's search path the functions should all be usable.

## Documentation

Documentation is available in the same way it is for all Octave functions, using the help command in the octave prompt.
